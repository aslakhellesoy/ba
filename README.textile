h1. Ba

Ba is a conference and event management system based on "Radiant":http://radiantcms.org/.
Ba aims to be minimalistic and reuse Radiant and other Radiant extensions as much as possible.

Essentially, Ba lets site admins create special "happening" pages which have additional properties
such as start date and end date. This page (and all sub pages) can then use special Ba tags to design
the conference site.

We chose the name Ba because it's Japanese for "a place that supports sharing and relationship building" 
and because Japanese is hot. Ba will be used for a 500 people conference, "Smidig 2008":http://smidig2008.no
and hopefully for lots of other conferences and other happenings in the future.

h2. Features

The features in Ba target 3 main roles: Organisers, speakers and regular attendees.

h3. Organizers

The organiser tools consist of extensions to the Radiant admin panel as well as custom tags.

* Create new happenings (conference or event).
* Set up a schedule/program
* Send mass emails to attendees
* Manage price/discount codes
* List attendees and billing status
* Several radius tags for happening related content

h3. Speakers

* Register talks/presentations
* Attach slides

h3. Attendees + speakers

* Maintain a bio

h2. Installation

The first thing you need to do is to create a clone of Radiant. You have two options:

h3. Clone a Radiant clone that already has Ba installed

"Aslak Helles√∏y's Radiant clone":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/radiant/tree/master already has
Ba (and other required extensions) installed as Git submodules. Here is how you get that:

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/aslakhellesoy/radiant.git radiant_ba
cd radiant_ba
git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

h3. Install Ba in your own Radiant clone

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/radiant/radiant.git radiant_ba
cd radiant_ba
git submodule add git://github.com/aslakhellesoy/ba.git vendor/extensions/ba
</code></pre>

h2. Development and running tests

First, set up you database configuration. Copy one of the config/database.xxx.yml to config/database.yml
If you're using anything else than "SQLite":http://www.sqlite.org/ (which works fine) you also need to 
create the database.

Now, let's create all the tables:

<pre><code>rake db:bootstrap
rake radiant:extensions:ba:migrate
</code></pre>

h2. Deployment

I recommend deploying Radiant+Ba to a POSIX server (Linux/Solaris), because that's what we're familiar with.
Use "Capistrano":http://www.capify.org/ for this.

You may try to package the whole thing into a war file with "Warbler":http://caldersphere.rubyforge.org/warbler/
and deploy it to a Java servlet container, but noone has tried this yet (to our knowledge).

h2. Contributing

Want to help out with development of Ba? Then the first step is to make sure you can run the awesome test suite
based on RSpec and RSpec's upcoming rewrite of executable user stories: "Cucumber":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree/master.

Make sure you have installed Ba and set up the database. 

If you installed Ba in your own Radiant clone (instead of cloning Aslak's Radiant clone), you
must apply "this little fix":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/radiant/commit/5ffea3c4dd5e3e7f7562bcd81fbcc125bf137ec5

Make sure you have Rubygems 1.2.0 installed. Now, install some libraries you'll need for testing:

<pre><code>cd RADIANT_ROOT
git submodule add git://github.com/brynary/webrat.git vendor/plugins/webrat
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
gem install cucumber
</code></pre>

Now you can run all the automated tests. They should all pass:

<pre><code>rake radiant:extensions:ba:stories_and_specs
</code></pre>

Read "8 steps for fixing other people's code":http://drnicwilliams.com/2007/06/01/8-steps-for-fixing-other-peoples-code/

You should really really write either stories or specs for the feature you're planning to implement/fix. If you
don't, we'll reject your patches. This is because we don't want to end up with a brittle, unmaintainable, undocumented
pile of code that noone understands. (Yes, stores and specs are *documentation* too).

If you don't know how to write specs or stories, snoop around and look at what's already there. They are really really
good examples written by experts in BDD/TDD. Write the specs/stories *before* you write the code. You'll end up writing
better (and less) code this way.
